$ terraform --version         # To check the terraform version
$ terraform init              # After variables.tf and provider.tf execute this command to initialize the provider.
$ terraform plan              # After variables.tf, provider.tf, deploy.tf and bootstrap.sh files execute this to check what all resources terraform will create. This will not create
$ terraform apply             # Finally this will create all the resources on your provider (in our case openstack).
$ terraform show              # It will show the metadata about the resources created. Like instance ip and other information.
$ terraform destroy           #Catious, it will delete all the resources created above
